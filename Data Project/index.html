        <h4>The War in Afghanistan Burns On</h4>
        <p>
          The American-led war in Afghanistan is approaching its 20th year of engagement. The current number of US troops in the country has dropped from the 2010 height of roughly 100,000 to an estimated 5,000 as of October 2020. The Costs of War
          project, based out of Brown University, released a comprehensive report in October of 2019 showcasing the number of direct war deaths within the country. While the US-led war against the Taliban has been the primary driver of violence,
          the overwhelming majority of those killed have been Afghan civilians, security forces, or opposition fighters. When asked to comment, Neta C. Crawford, one of the report’s authors, emphasized that civilian casualties have increased under
          the Trump administration, due to the increased use of airstrikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We did see an uptick in civilian deaths that are correlated with the relaxed rules of engagement and the increase in weapons released, or airstrikes. So that's the trend through early 2020.”
        </p>
        <p>

          Negotiations between the US, the Taliban, and the Afghan government are currently underway.
